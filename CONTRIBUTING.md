# CONTRIBUTING.md

Before contributing, check whether the algorithm has already been implemented or not.

### Setting up the repo locally

1. Fork the repo in your account.

2. Clone it into your machine.

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/algorithms_with_git.git
   ```

3. Create a branch for your algorithm.

   ```
   git checkout -b <branch_name>
   ```

### Adding a brand new algorithm

1. Make a folder for your algorithm. The folder name should be descriptive. Use underscores instead of spaces.
2. Put your program in that folder. Keep the program name as similar as possible to the folder name.
3. Add documentation for your program. You can use the [DOCUMENTATION\_TEMPLATE](DOCUMENTATION_TEMPLATE.md) for this. Algorithms without a basic documentation (description, input/output format, sample input/output) will **not** be accepted.
4. Update the List of Algorithms in [README](README.md) with your algorithm.
5. Commit and push the changes, then submit a Pull Request.

### Implementing an algorithm in another language

1. Put your algorithm in the corresponding algorithm folder.
2. Update the corresponding README.
3. Commit and push the changes, then submit a Pull Request.

A sample algorithm [Maximum of Array](algorithms/Array/maximum_of_array) has already been implemented for you.
